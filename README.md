# TDMP Launcher Updater Downloader
Standalone PowerShell script that downloads and installs the prerequisites for the teardown multiplayermod. It then downloads the TDMP Launcher Updater, moves it to your documents and then make a desktop shortcut.

You should only need this script once to setup and then the TDMP Launcher Updater will keep you updated.

Only tested on Windows 10 but 11 Should work as well. Download source code or latest release and then run the script. Some people may need to right-click and click "Run with PowerShell".
